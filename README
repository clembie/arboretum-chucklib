Arboretum ChucKLib - Michael Clemow, 2009

This collection of code comprises a personal library that I run on 
a cluster of Linux machines called The Arboretum.  Not all of it was 
designed to run on networks and much of it is useful without one.  

I keep a copy of these files on each of the nodes in the cluster and
run the arb_init.ck file over the network to add those files to the
running ChucK virtual machines on those nodes.  init.ck is for running
the code locally.  

This code is open-source and I make no promises as to its safety or 
usefulness.
